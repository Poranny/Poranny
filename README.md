## Hi there! 👋 

My name is Adam, I'm passionate about Reinforcement Learning, simulation software (especially electromagnetism and particle physics), and 3D visualization. Currently pursuing a master's in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence at Poznań University of Technology.

### ⚙️ Currently working on

- **[Sssnake-solver](https://github.com/Poranny/Sssnake-solver)** – exploring RL algorithms that could help solve my [Sssnake](https://github.com/Poranny/Sssnake) env;
- trying out interesting transformer models from HuggingFace.

---

### 🛠️ Tech stack
- **Python** – using it for most projects these days, with the help of `Gymnasium`, `Stable Baselines`, `PyTorch`, `scikit-learn` etc. for ML/RL, data-driven and other tasks;
- **C++** - for performance-critical applications and parallel computing, often involving `OpenMP`, `CUDA`, or `OpenGL`;
- **C#** - mostly for fun game dev side projects, usually with the help of `Unity` game engine.

I'm also a 3D Artist! Obsessed with all kinds of hyperrealism, these days working mostly on product ads and game trailers. You can find my ArtStation profile below :)
